      <td>Lead time for changes</td>
      <td>One of the critical DevOps metrics to track is lead time for changes. Not to be confused with cycle time (discussed below), lead time for changes is the length of time between when a code change is committed to the trunk branch and when it is in a deployable state. For example, when code passes all necessary pre-release tests.</td>

      <td>Mean time to recovery</td>
      <td>Mean time to recovery (MTTR) measures how long it takes to recover from a partial service interruption or total failure. This is an important metric to track, regardless of whether the interruption is the result of a recent deployment or an isolated system failure. </td>

      <td>17</td>
      <td>Monolithic</td>
      <td>A monolithic architecture is a traditional model of a software program, which is built as a unified unit that is self-contained and independent from other applications. A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together. To make a change to this sort of application requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface. This makes updates restrictive and time-consuming.</td>

      <td>Service-oriented architecture (SOA)</td>
      <td>SOA is an architectural pattern in computer software design. In this type of application, components provide services to other components via a communications protocol, typically over a network. The principles of service-orientation are independent of any product, vendor, or technology. The full form of SOA is service-oriented architecture</td>
